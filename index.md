### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, Part 2

    Part 2 of lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time I learned how to create a program for a game. The game being the Hi-Lo game where one player chooses a number and then the second player has to guess that number. While creating this program, I got to learn how to use if-statements to determine whether the guess made was too high, too low, or correct. Although I did struggle a bit, getting to finish the program and test it felt quite satisfying!

* Lab 7, Part 1

    Part 1 of lab 7 was a program that we had created in one of the earlier labs where the user was prompted to enter a start date and an end date in order to determine the difference in days between them, except this time around, we got to use the command line to enter those values. I included this lab because I learned how to write code that determined whether or not there were enough arguments in the command line and I was able to learn how to convert and assign the argument at a certain location to the variables used. This lab helped solidify my knowledge on these topics.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, I have to say, is probably my favorite lab that we did. My partner and I were able to create animation for the first time, and honestly it was just super satisfying seeing all the knowledge we gained in the past labs come together in this lab. Plus, I was also able to gain some more knowledge such as how to combine red, green, and blue channels and the images into a GIF. Overall, it was just a super fun lab and the end result was amazing.
